I chose this question (Is it rude to move to an unsold seat on a plane?), because this is something I do a lot, and I wanted to know how it's perceived by other people.
I found it interesting that 37 people said that it is very rude. I didn't expect all these people to answer this way.
However, my graph shows that the biggest percentace of people (690) thinks that it is not rude at all.
